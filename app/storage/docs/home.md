## The Basics

Welcome to the Codezilla docs. These documents were designed to function both as a getting-started guide and as a feature reference for all Codezilla products. Even though you may jump into any section and start learning, I recommend reading the documentation in order as it allows me to progressively establish concepts that will be used in later documents.

All documents are openly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/BastianHofmann/codezilla-documentations "Documentations on GitHub"). If you found a typo, or think you can word a section better, go ahead and submit a pull request. Your contribution is much appreciated.

## About

Codezilla provides PHP scripts, mostly Web Applications, for you to learn from and to use in your own projects. All items are using best practices and are designed for real enviroments. If you want to see what's under the hood of real applications, Codezilla is the way to go.

The web is a rapidly evolving organism, which is why I think it's important to provide support, documentation and above all updates for my scripts. Codezilla tries to do just that and even more. If you think there is a features this services needs, feel free to [Contact](http://codezilla.help/contact "Contact Codezilla") me. I'm always open for your thoughts.
